### Local Development

To run `burnout-questionnaire` locally, you can start it with the `pnpm` commands. You need to set up and run the command in the root directory.

Make sure to install the dependencies first. For this project `pnpm` is used so first, if you don't have it installed, download it and then install the dependencies.

`pnpm install`

To run the project:

`pnpm dev`

Consider that the project uses `Nextjs v13`, `Tailwind CSS`, `pnpm`, among other libraries.
